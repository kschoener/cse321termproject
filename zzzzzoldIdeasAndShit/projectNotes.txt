After this is completed, I want to not only be able to see messages but send them and load new messages.
ssibly set up the raspberry pi as a server on the network, and have devices send their usages to the raspberry pi
    this would require a distro to install on devices (probably with python)

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4760215/running-shell-command-from-python-and-capturing-the-output
go to this link for a tutorial on how to capture command line output from python


use '$ netstat -sp' to count packets sent and received

use '$ arp -a' to see all devices on the network

**determine distance from other devices (ping)

'$ sudo tcpdump' prints out all current connections sent and received









IF THIS ALL FAILS:

another idea -- attach a RC receiver//transmitter to the raspberry pi and use it to be programmable -- maybe take over someone's drone to be devious

PROBABLY GOING TO NEED ANOTHER IDEA -- CRAZY AMOUNT OF REQUIREMENTS

build the portable photo album idea with raspberry pi!!!!!

OR build a news summarizer that takes stories from big news sites and the weather and displays it on the screen use Python and/or Go and/or Javascript

fuck the network viewing shit
